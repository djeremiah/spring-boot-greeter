= Spring Boot Config

This example shows how to bootstrap kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configmap/[ConfigMap] to the Spring Boot properties

== Build and Deploying

[code,sh]
----
./mvn clean fabric8:deploy

oc get pods -w <1>
----

<1> Ensure the application is deployed and available to run

== Accessing application

Find the route of the applicaiton using the command `oc get route spring-boot-greeter`, and try the following

[code,sh]
----
curl $(oc get route spring-boot-greeter | awk 'END{print $2}')/greet/<name>
----

This should display the greeting with prefix configured for property `greeter.prefix` link:./src/main/fabric8/cm.yaml[cm.yaml]


=== Applying changes

Edit the config map via `oc edit configmap spring-boot-greeter` and change the `greeter.prefix`,
you will notice the spring boot application redeployed. Any new calls to the API will have the updated
`greeter.prefix`
